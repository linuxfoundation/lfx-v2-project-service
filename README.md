# LFX V2 Member Service

This repository contains the source code for the LFX v2 platform member service.

## Overview

The LFX v2 Member Service is a RESTful API service that provides membership data
within the Linux Foundation's LFX platform. It exposes endpoints for querying
project memberships and key contacts, write endpoints for managing B2B orgs
(create, update, access-control settings) and key contacts (create, update,
delete), and an admin reindex endpoint for pushing data into OpenSearch. Data is
sourced directly from Salesforce via SOQL queries, with a per-record NATS
Key-Value cache to minimise round-trips.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API**: Endpoints for querying project memberships and key contacts,
  write endpoints for B2B orgs and key contacts, org access-control settings
  (writers/auditors), and an admin reindex endpoint.
- **Salesforce-backed**: All membership data is fetched directly from Salesforce
  via SOQL queries; no PostgreSQL dependency at runtime.
- **NATS KV cache**: Three buckets — `membership-cache` for Salesforce-backed
  records (6 h stale / 23 h expire / 24 h TTL); `member-service-cache` for
  Salesforce sObject REST responses (raw JSON, no soft-TTL); and `org-settings`
  for authoritative org access-control settings (no TTL, optimistic locking).
- **Project ID resolution**: The `ProjectResolver` translates v2 project UIDs to
  Salesforce `Project__c.Id` values by chaining a NATS RPC to the project-service
  and a SOQL lookup, backed by the same KV cache.
- **NATS RPC endpoint**: Exposes a request/reply subject so other services can
  resolve a v2 project UID to a Salesforce `Project__c.Id` without querying
  Salesforce or PostgreSQL directly.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows hexagonal architecture with clear separation of
  domain, service, and infrastructure layers.
- **Authorization**: JWT-based authentication with Heimdall middleware integration
  and OpenFGA fine-grained access control.
- **Health Checks**: Built-in `/livez` and `/readyz` endpoints.
- **Request Tracking**: Automatic request ID generation and propagation.
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with contextual information.

## API Endpoints

### Project membership

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/project_memberships/{uid}` | Get a project membership |

### Key contacts (nested under project_membership)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/project_memberships/{membership_uid}/key_contacts/{uid}` | Get a key contact |
| POST | `/project_memberships/{membership_uid}/key_contacts` | Create a key contact |
| PUT | `/project_memberships/{membership_uid}/key_contacts/{uid}` | Update a key contact |
| DELETE | `/project_memberships/{membership_uid}/key_contacts/{uid}` | Remove a key contact |

### B2B orgs

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/b2b_orgs` | Create a B2B org from a Salesforce Account SFID |
| PUT | `/b2b_orgs/{uid}` | Partial update of a B2B org |
| GET | `/b2b_orgs/{uid}` | Get a B2B org |
| GET | `/b2b_orgs/{uid}/settings` | Get org access-control settings (writers, auditors) |
| PUT | `/b2b_orgs/{uid}/settings` | Update org access-control settings (writers, auditors) |

### Admin

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/admin/reindex` | Trigger a full or incremental reindex of cached entities into OpenSearch (requires global org-admin membership) |

### Utility

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/readyz` | Readiness check |
| GET | `/livez` | Liveness check |

> **Note:** The legacy `/members/*` and `/memberships/*` endpoints are no longer
> registered and return `404 Not Found`; use the replacement paths above.

## NATS API

In addition to the HTTP API, the service handles NATS request/reply subjects
that allow other services to resolve identifiers without querying Salesforce or
this service's HTTP layer directly.

### Project ID Map Lookup

Resolves a v2 project UUID to its corresponding Salesforce `Project__c.Id`.
Resolution is cached in the `membership-cache` KV bucket; a cache miss triggers
a NATS RPC to the project-service (to obtain the project slug) followed by a
Salesforce SOQL query.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Subject** | `lfx.member.project-id-map.lookup` |
| **Transport** | NATS core request/reply |

**Request body (JSON):**

```json
{"project_uid": "<v2 project UUID>"}
```

**Response — success (HTTP 200 equivalent):**

```json
{"project_sfid": "<Salesforce Project__c.Id>"}
```

**Response — not found:**

```json
{"error": "project not found"}
```

**Response — bad request:**

```json
{"error": "project_uid is required"}
```

The reply is always valid JSON. Check for the presence of the `"error"` key to
detect failure.

### B2B Org UID Resolution

As of the SFID-as-uid change, `b2b_org.uid` equals the canonical 18-char Salesforce Account
SFID directly — no NATS RPC lookup is required. Callers that have the Account SFID can use
it as the `b2b_org` UID without any further resolution.

### Building

```bash
make apigen    # Generate Goa API code
make build     # Build the member-api binary
make test      # Run tests
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# With NATS and Salesforce credentials
export NATS_URL=nats://localhost:4222
export SF_INSTANCE_URL=https://linuxfoundation.my.salesforce.com
export SF_CLIENT_ID=<connected-app-client-id>
export SF_CLIENT_SECRET=<connected-app-client-secret>
./bin/member-api

# With mock data (no NATS or Salesforce required)
REPOSITORY_SOURCE=mock AUTH_SOURCE=mock ./bin/member-api

# With mock auth only (NATS + Salesforce still required)
export JWT_AUTH_DISABLED_MOCK_LOCAL_PRINCIPAL=local-dev-user
./bin/member-api
```

### Salesforce Credentials

The service reads credentials from environment variables. A pre-existing
Kubernetes Secret is required in production; see the Helm chart `values.yaml`
`salesforce.secrets` stanza for configuration.

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `SF_INSTANCE_URL` | Salesforce instance URL | Yes |
| `SF_CLIENT_ID` | Connected-app consumer key | Yes |
| `SF_CLIENT_SECRET` | Consumer secret (username/password or client-credentials flow) | Conditional |
| `SF_USERNAME` | Salesforce username (username/password or JWT flow) | Conditional |
| `SF_PASSWORD` | Salesforce password (username/password flow) | Conditional |
| `SF_SECURITY_TOKEN` | Security token appended to password | No |
| `SF_CONSUMER_RSA_PEM` | PEM-encoded RSA private key (JWT bearer flow) | Conditional |
| `SF_API_VERSION` | Salesforce REST API version (default: `v60.0`) | No |

At least one complete authentication flow must be configured:

- **JWT bearer**: `SF_USERNAME` + `SF_CONSUMER_RSA_PEM`
- **Username/password**: `SF_USERNAME` + `SF_PASSWORD` + `SF_CLIENT_SECRET`
- **Client-credentials**: `SF_CLIENT_SECRET` (without `SF_USERNAME`)
